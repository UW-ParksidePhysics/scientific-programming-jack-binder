%This program would be able to calculate the distance between the earth 
%and the sun at 4 different points around the orbital axis as it goes 
%around the sun. It is done by using as input of kepler 3rd law and 
%equation of motion. More specifically finding the distance(m) at 4 
%different seasons within a 1 year span. We already know two positions distance
%and will find a function to help calculate at 2-4 other points. The earth travels
%around the sun in an orbital function. 
% Simulation parameters
%	These are values particular to the simulation 
%	that do not change later in the script
%rp = apoapsis

%ra = periapsis
% Computed parameters (from simulation parameters)
%	These are values that do not change later in the script
%	and are calculated from formulas using the simulation parameters
% Values: rp = 1 and ra=2 For the meantime

%d = distance
% Function calls and simple calculations for:
%	data read-in
%	simulation solution 
%	visualization
%The two points at which the code would read would be aphelion(152,100 km) and Perihelion(147,300 km). Moving in an orbital motion around the sun to find 2 
%more points. 

%Data read in would be the distances mentioned previosuly. 

%Finding c, a, and b in which c^2=sqrt(a^2 + b^2)


% Function definitions for simulation solution & visualization
%	Each function contains help text: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/add-help-for-your-program.html
%Focal Distance c = (1/2)*(ra - rp)

%semi major axis a = (1/2)*(ra + rp)

%Graph
a = 10;
b = 5;

thetas = (0:.1:2.*pi);
for i = a
    for j = b
        xs = a.*cos(thetas);
        ys = b.*sin(thetas);
        plot(xs,ys)
    end

%Review
%Question 1: The code does run without any errors
%Question 2: The graph lack information. The axis should be labeled and there should be a legend to make it easier to understand
%Question 3: The code was a little tricky to read but that was because, at the time I reviewed it, he commented a lot out and I think he did that just 
           % to have a program with an acceptable output and he'll go back and bring those commented lines back in
%Question 4: The intro at the top clearly states what he's trying to solve. If I were him, I would make comments describing what each variable means 
%Question 5: The variables do describe what they are, but as mentioned in the previous questions, he should describe what they are as the variables 
           % used in his program aren't necessarily common knowledge
%Question 6: It's hard to say at the moment because most of his variables are commented out. However, by the looks of it, the variables that he'll use
           % will give him the solution he needs
%Question 7: As of right now, the visualization doesn't show the solution, but once he adds more information to the graph, then I think you'll be able 
           % to see the solution
